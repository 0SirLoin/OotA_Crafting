# Craft Points System Summary

## Overview
The Craft Points system provides a streamlined way to handle item creation in D&D 3.5. Characters can spend Craft Points to create items more quickly than using standard crafting rules. The number of Craft Points required to craft an item is based on its cost.

### Key Points:
- **Craft Points** represent the time and effort needed to craft items.
- **Craft Points cost** is typically 1 Craft Point per 10 gp of an item's market price.
- Characters can spend Craft Points to complete crafting in a fraction of the normal time.

## Craft Points Cost Calculation
To calculate the Craft Points needed to craft an item:
- Divide the item's market price by 10 to determine the Craft Points required.

**Example**: An item with a market price of 300 gp requires 30 Craft Points.
