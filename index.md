# Craft Points System Summary

## Overview
The Craft Points system provides a streamlined way to handle item creation in D&D 3.5. Characters can spend Craft Points to create items more quickly than using standard crafting rules. The number of Craft Points required to craft an item is based on its cost.

### Key Points:
- **Craft Points** represent the time and effort needed to craft items.
- **Craft Points cost** is typically 1 Craft Point per 10 gp of an item's market price.
- Characters can spend Craft Points to complete crafting in a fraction of the normal time.

## Craft Points Cost Calculation
To calculate the Craft Points needed to craft an item:
- Divide the item's market price by 10 to determine the Craft Points required.

**Example**: An item with a market price of 300 gp requires 30 Craft Points.

## Crafting Feats

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
